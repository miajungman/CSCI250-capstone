We will be using exactly three complex sensors, in addition to push buttons and LEDs. Our concept for this project is to compare frequencies collected by the microphone sensor to the accepted frequencies for each correctly-tuned string on an acoustic guitar. To acomplish the prject components requirements we will do the following.\n",
    "Microphone sensor - collect sound data from the guitar strings.\n",
    "Analog-to-digital converter (ADC) - to convert the analog sound data into digital data .\n",
    "Rpi - process the sound data and analyze the frequency content of the signal.\n",
    "LED display - display useful information such as the frequency of the guitar string and whether it is in tune or not.\n",
    "Buttons - allow the user to select which guitar string they want to tune.\n",
    "Buzzer - provide audible feedback when the guitar string is in tune."
